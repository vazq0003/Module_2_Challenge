# Module_2_Challenge
This is my Module 2 Challenge submission

In this challenge I used for loops, conditional statements, and functions to populate the requested outputs and then format them using conditional formatting. 
I was unable to get my three calculated values (Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume) to work so those have been excluded from my code.
This repository includes screenshots of each excel output tab as well as a file containing my VBA script.
